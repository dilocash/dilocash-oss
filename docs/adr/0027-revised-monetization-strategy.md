## 1. Context and Problem Statement

We need a monetization strategy that ensures the long-term viability of the project without compromising the high-end fintech experience or user privacy.

## 2. Decision Drivers

- Preserve a premium, ad-free user experience.
- Protect user financial privacy from third-party trackers.
- Secure a sustainable revenue stream for core development.

## 3. Consequences

Dilocash will operate on an **Open Core SaaS** model, explicitly prohibiting display ads or rewarded ad-walls.

- **OSS Core:** Provides the essential voice-to-ledger functionality for free.
- **Premium Repo:** Revenue is driven by advanced features (Bank Sync, Household management, Custom AI limits).

- **Positive:** 100% ad-free experience leads to higher user retention and trust.
- **Positive:** Faster UX without the latency or visual clutter of third-party trackers.
- **Negative:** Requires a higher initial user base or higher premium conversion rate to reach profitability compared to ad-supported models.
