# ADR-019: Brand Asset Protection

- **Status**: Accepted

## 1. Context and Problem Statement

As an Open Core project, the "Dilocash" brand name and its associated digital handles are primary assets. Allowing third parties to claim these identifiers on chat platforms or social media creates significant brand confusion and business risk.

## 2. Decision Drivers

- Protect user trust by preventing "copycat" bots.
- Ensure consistent brand identity across all adapters.
- Establish a clear corporate presence for the commercial entity.

## 3. Consequences

Execute a preemptive "land grab" strategy for all `dilocash` digital identifiers across primary platforms.

- **Domains:** Secure `dilocash.com` for the commercial portal.
- **Handles:** Register `@dilocash` on Telegram, WhatsApp Business, and major social networks.
- **Organization:** Move the repository to the `dilocash-oss` GitHub organization.

- **Positive:** Prevents brand hijacking and phishing attempts.
- **Positive:** Provides a professional, unified entry point for all users.
- **Negative:** Requires ongoing management of multiple social and domain accounts.
